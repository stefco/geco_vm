To open up a jupyter (nee ipython notebook) server, run

    notebook

and, on your host computer, navigate to localhost:8888

To open up MEDM screens to the sites, make sure you have an xwindow viewer
installed on your host computer (and restart after installing it to make sure
that it is recognized by vagratn). Then, run

    medm_lho -u <your-ligo-username>

or

    medm_llo -u <your-ligo-username>

to see MEDM screens for each site.

To log on to LIGO Data Grid, you need to authenticate by running

    ligo-proxy-init <your-ligo-username>

and then enter your password. Then, use `gsissh` and `gsiscp` (in place of
ssh and scp) as you normally would to access site computers. For example,
you can log into ldas-pcdev1 at the hanford site with

    gsissh ldas-pcdev1.ligo-wa.caltech.edu
