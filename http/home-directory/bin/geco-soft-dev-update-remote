USAGE: geco-soft-update-and-connect [ -h ] <hostname>

Install and/or update GECo software on a remote host using GSI authentication,
then connect to the remote host.

  - downloads installation/update scripts on a remote host
  - runs them and prints current progress
  - makes sure that ~/bin is in PATH on the remote host
  - opens a terminal with an ssh connection to the host

This is useful for when you need to work on a remote host and want to easily
make sure it is using the same GECo software as your computer.
