<p>To get going quickly:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> and
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant</a>.</li>
<li>Download the GECo VM 
<a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_vm/raw/master/vagrantfiles/ubuntu-12.04-gui/Vagrantfile">Vagrantfile</a>
and save it in the directory where you plan do do your work.</li>
<li>Open a terminal, change to the directory where you saved your Vagrantfile,
and run <code>vagrant up</code> to download and start the machine. A window with the
virtual machine's desktop should pop up. Run <code>vagrant halt</code> while in that
same directory to shut the machine down.</li>
<li>Either log into the desktop interface (it should log in automatically, but
for reference, both password and username are "vagrant") or log in via ssh by
  running <code>vagrant ssh</code> on your host computer while in the Vagrantfile
  directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! See more instructions and tips below.</p>

<a id="introduction" class="anchor" href="#introduction" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a virtual machine with all important LIGO-related software
pre-installed.</p>

<p>I am building this because dealing with LIGO's toolkit dependencies is a hassle
and, for researchers who just need to get going with their work, a waste of
time. Doing any work at remotely is a difficult proposition (unless you are
<code>ssh</code>ed into a LIGO server, which is sometimes impossible or undesirable, and
in any case requires credentials and its own special software for anything
besides SSH), and setup instructions are not uniform across OSes. <a href="http://geco.markalab.org">My
group</a> at Columbia University is currently using this
Virtual Machine to avoid all of these issues, but I imagine we are not the only
ones who have encountered these hurdles, so I hope that other labs might find
this useful.</p>

<a id="gui-vs-no-gui" class="anchor" href="#gui-vs-no-gui" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GUI vs. No-GUI</h3>

<p><strong>There are two versions of <code>geco-vm</code>:</strong> one <em>with</em> a GUI (graphical user
interface) and one without. The GUI version is called <code>geco-vm-gui</code>; it is the
more beginner-friendly version. It is more resource intensive, however, and is
only available for desktop (not server) use. If you know what you are doing and
prefer working from the command line anyway, or if performance and resource
usage are important considerations, you should use the headless (i.e.
GUI-free), lightweight <code>geco-vm</code>; otherwise, <code>geco-vm-gui</code> has all the same
capabilities but comes with a familiar desktop interface and nice features like
shared clipboard (you can copy text within the virtual machine and paste it in
your host computer, and vice versa) and drag-and-drop file movement (this
feature only works for dragging files into the VM). See the <a href="#pro-tips">Pro
Tips</a> section below for more information applicable to both GUI and
headless version.</p>

<h3>
<a id="installing-and-getting-started" class="anchor" href="#installing-and-getting-started" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing and Getting Started</h3>

<p>If you just want to <em>use</em> the virtual machine, you can follow these instructions
to get started. These instructions should work on any system.</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install the latest version of <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>.</li>
<li>Download and install the latest version of <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant</a>
</li>
<li>Download either the
<a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_vm/raw/master/vagrantfiles/ubuntu-12.04-gui/Vagrantfile">GUI Vagrantfile</a>
or the
<a href="https://github.com/stefco/geco_vm/raw/master/vagrantfiles/ubuntu-12.04/Vagrantfile">headless Vagrantfile</a>
to the folder you want to work in.</li>
<li>Run <code>vagrant up</code> to download and boot the virtual machine.</li>
<li>Run <code>vagrant ssh</code> to start using the virtual machine; <strong>for the GUI
version</strong>, you can just use the virtual machine window that
pops. It should log you in automatically when the VM starts up. For
reference, the username and password are both "vagrant".</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! Once you are <code>ssh</code>ed into the guest machine, it is just like using
<code>ssh</code> with any other machine. Similarly, the GUI expriece should be just like
using any Ubuntu box. While <code>ssh</code>ed, you can run <code>exit</code> to return to the host
machine.  While not using the guest machine, you can simply run <code>vagrant</code> to
get a short list of available commands for managing this VM.</p>

<h4>
<a id="full-instructions-with-explanation" class="anchor" href="#full-instructions-with-explanation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Full Instructions, With Explanation</h4>

<p>It is easy to make mistakes while upgrading to the latest version of
vagrant if you don't know what you're doing. This can cause you to waste
hours troubleshooting a broken feature that has been fixed on the latest
version of the box simply because you think you've already upgraded (when
in fact you haven't). Knowing how vagrant works
can help immensely in avoiding this peculiar debugging hell.</p>

<p>When you initialize your virtual machine with <code>vagrant up</code>, vagrant does the
following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Checks whether you already have a copy of <code>stefco/geco-vm</code> saved in vagrant's
cache of vagrant boxes</li>
<li>Downloads the latest copy of <code>stefco/geco-vm</code> if you do not have a local
copy; if you <strong>do</strong> have a local copy, <strong>even if it is outdated</strong>, vagrant
will use that one</li>
<li>Decompresses and copies your local copy of the <code>stefco/geco-vm</code> box and
stores that fresh copy of the virtual machine in the <code>~/Virtualbox\ VMs</code>
directory; this copy will be the virtual machine you use</li>
<li>Starts up the new machine</li>
<li>Runs any provisioning scripts that you specify
(which allow you to further customize the box before you use it)</li>
<li>Mounts shared folders</li>
</ol>

<p>Note the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simply updating your cached vagrant box to the latest version with
<code>vagrant box update</code> will only update your cached box; <strong>this alone will
not have any effect on the virtual machine you are already using.</strong>
</li>
<li>Destroying and recreating your machine using <code>vagrant destroy -f</code>
followed by <code>vagrant up</code> will just create a fresh version of the old
box; you need to make sure you also update the cached
copy of the vagrant box using <code>vagrant box update</code> before you
reinitialize the virtual machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, to make sure you are using the latest and greatest version of <code>stefco/geco-vm</code>,
you should make sure you are in your vagrant working directory on your host
machine and run:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>vagrant destroy -f
vagrant box remove -f --all stefco/geco-vm
vagrant up</pre></div>

<p>You can check on your cached version of this (and all) vagrant boxes by running
<code>vagrant box list</code>, and you can see whether you successfully deleted your
running copy of the virtual machine by running <code>vagrant status</code>.</p>

<h4>
<a id="vagrant-best-practices" class="anchor" href="#vagrant-best-practices" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Vagrant Best Practices</h4>

<p>You should think of your virtual machine as disposable; ideally, you should
not store any information on it long term. Because Vagrant 
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/synced_folders.html">automatically shares</a>
your host computer's vagrant folder (i.e. the folder in which your Vagrantfile
is located) with the guest virtual machine under the <code>/vagrant</code> directory, it
is trivially easy to keep your work saved on your host machine by keeping it
in the <code>/vagrant</code> directory of the guest machine. This way, if you have to
delete your virtual machine (for example, if you are upgrading to the latest
version), you can do so without having to worry about lost work.</p>

<h4>
<a id="adding-custom-scripts" class="anchor" href="#adding-custom-scripts" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Adding Custom Scripts</h4>

<p>You can add custom scripts to your path by putting them in the <code>/home/vagrant</code>
directory on the host machine. You can also add those scripts to a <code>bin</code>
folder in the directory on your host machine where the <code>Vagrantfile</code> is
located (since this directory is shared with <code>geco-vm</code> through the
<code>/vagrant</code> directory).</p>

<a id="previewing-images-with-iterm2" class="anchor" href="#previewing-images-with-iterm2" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Previewing Images with iTerm2</h4>

<p>If you are using a mac with the latest build of
<a href="http://iterm2.com/downloads.html">iTerm2</a> (something I highly recommend, since
iTerm2 is an excellent terminal emulator), you can use <code>imgcat</code> to preview
images on your virtual machine <em>right in your terminal</em> during an
ssh session. This is nice for e.g. taking a quick look at a fresh plot
without leaving the command line.</p>

<h2>
<a id="developing-the-base-image" class="anchor" href="#developing-the-base-image" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Developing the Base Image</h2>

<p>This machine is built and deployed using a tool called Packer, made by the same
people who make Vagrant. Configuration information for creating a virtual
machine using <a href="https://www.packer.io/">Packer</a> can be found on their 
website. The important idea, though, is that Packer
uses a template file (in our case, <code>geco-vm.json</code>) to specify:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Builders</strong>, which take an installation disk image (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
64-bit, in our case) and make a fresh installation in a new virtual
machine using the providers of your choice (for us, only VirtualBox, though
you can get crazy with VMWare, DigitalOcean, Amazon AWS, Docker, etc.)</li>
<li>
<strong>Provisioners</strong>, which handle file-copying and script running (usually
runnning a dependency install script, like <code>provision.sh</code>, in our case);
this is the part where you get to customize the box with whatever you need.</li>
<li>
<strong>Post-Processors</strong>, which package the resulting virtual machine image so
that it can be used by Vagrant, and which automatically upload the images
to Atlas (see below).</li>
</ul>

<p>After installing the latest version of <code>packer</code>, there is one step you will
have to take before you can build the machine for yourself. Because Atlas
requires authentication to deploy a newly build vagrant box, you must either:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the final deployment step from the <code>ubuntu-12.04-amd64.json</code> template
file, or</li>
<li>Create your own free Atlas account at atlas.hashicorp.com, create a
new Packer project, and modify the template file to point to your now project.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To remove the deployment step</strong> from the template file, delete <em>precisely</em>
these lines:</p>

<pre><code>    },
    {
      "type": "atlas",
      "only": ["virtualbox-iso"],
      "artifact": "stefco/geco-vm",
      "artifact_type": "vagrant.box",
      "metadata": {
        "provider": "virtualbox",
        "created_at": "{{timestamp}}"
      }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>To point to your newly created packer project</strong>, modify <em>only</em> the
"artifact" line in the above code section, changing it from:</p>

<pre><code>"artifact": "stefco/geco-vm",
</code></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><code>"artifact": "your_atlas_username/your_packer_project_name",
</code></pre>

<p>Now that that is finished, you can start running with</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre>packer build ubuntu-12.04-amd64.json</pre></div>

<p>and, after a considerable amount of time, you should have a fresh copy of
the vm ready to play with.</p>

<p>Of course, you can modify it as you like, and
if you add features that will be useful to others, I will happily incorporate
those changes into the base box.</p>

<p><a href="http://kappataumu.com/articles/creating-an-Ubuntu-VM-with-packer.html">This tutorial</a>
was invaluable in getting going quickly with Packer. I also found
<a href="http://blog.endpoint.com/2014/03/provisioning-development-environment.html">this</a>
helpful. And, of course, Packer's own documentation is invaluable.</p>

<p>As far as provisioning LIGO tools, I drew inspiration from
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">DASWG</a>'s page, from scripts written
by Szabi for provisioning his own Debian box, from conversations with people at
the observatories, and from the gwpy .travis.yml configuration scripts. There
are also plenty of good <a href="https://wiki.ligo.org/RemoteAccess/WebHome">instructions</a>
on various remote access topics on the LIGO wiki.</p>

<p>If you want to start with Vagrant's default "blank" Vagrantfile, you can
generate one by running <code>vagrant init stefco/geco-vm</code>. This creates a 
simple Vagrantfile for this box, with some helpful comments on how you can
modify the file to your liking. There are a couple of features of the
geco_vm box that are specified in the repository Vagrantfile above, so you
should probably just go ahead and use that one.</p>

<p>You can read Vagrant's documentation on their
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">website</a> for more information.</p>
